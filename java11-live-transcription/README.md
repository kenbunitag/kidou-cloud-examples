Java 11 live transcription
=

Live transcription using the default microphone and the Java 11 WebSocket API.

Opens default microphone for 10 seconds and prints live transcription on stdout.

# Usage
Just open the project inside IntelliJ or any other IDE supporting Apache Maven and start the main method. Don't forget to insert the API key into the marked variable.

Remember that this is an example project without exception handling. If something does not work, take a look into the console.

# Dependencies
Since Java 11 the JDK contains a WebSocket client implementation, so we don't have any dependencies.
