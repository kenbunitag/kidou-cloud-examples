# KIDOU CLOUD examples
Examples in different programming languages for the KIDOU CLOUD API. See the subfolders for the different examples.

We provide solutions for two different use cases:
- Live transcription by sending microphone recorded audio continously to a websocket
- Audio file transcription by sending an audio file with HTTP POST

Using our transcription API requires an API key and API credits. By registering at https://cloud.kidou.ai you can create API keys and we gift you 1000 credits for free to test! For extensive tests you can request for more free credits.
